## Checking the results
Open the browser and navigate to `http://{HOST IP ADDRESS}:8123/` to see the results.
 
To get the host IP address, you can use the `ipconfig` command in the command prompt. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the command prompt by pressing `Win + R` and typing `cmd`.
2. In the command prompt, type `ipconfig` and press Enter.
3. Look for the "IPv4 Address" under the "Ethernet adapter" or "Wireless LAN adapter" section. This is your host IP address.

Once you have the host IP address, you can use it to navigate to `http://{HOST IP ADDRESS}:8123/` in your browser to see the results.
